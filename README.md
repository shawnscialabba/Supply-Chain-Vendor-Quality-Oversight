# Supply-Chain-Vendor-Quality-Oversight

### Summary

Developed and executed a revised vendor audit program to enhance compliance with NAVSEA and DOE governance requirements and meet NQA-1 supplier qualification standards. Directed nuclear fabrication Quality Assurance (QA) under NQA-1, ASME III/IX, and ISO 19443.

### Scope & Strategy

*   Trained and certified a team of lead auditors in NQA-1 and 10 CFR 50 Appendix B auditing principles.
*   Implemented a risk-based "Graded Approach" for vendor selection and oversight (Document control, OQE verification, material traceability, procurement flowdowns).

### Results

*   Achieved a **30% reduction in documentation errors** and a **25% reduction in quality escapes** through RCA/CAPA and enhanced configuration control.
*   Restored full QA authority and achieved full compliance under DOE/NAVSEA/NRC-equivalent expectations.
